Storage and Dispensing Mechanism
Attached Clean Water Reservoir: Add a small container or bottle that collects and stores the filtered water, allowing for easy dispensing when needed.
Spout or Tap: Install a simple tap or spout at the bottom of the reservoir to make it easy to pour without spilling.
UV Light Sterilization
UV Pen or Small UV Light: Placing a small UV sterilizer after filtration helps kill remaining bacteria and viruses, especially useful for biological safety. A portable UV pen could be placed in the reservoir to add a final purification step.
Post-Filtration Mineralization
Mineral Stones: Adding minerals like calcite or quartz after the main filter can help balance the pH and add a subtle mineral taste to the water, making it healthier and more enjoyable to drink.
Recyclable or Replaceable Filter Cartridges
Modular Filter Compartments: Design replaceable filter cartridges or layers that can be swapped out, making maintenance easier and increasing the filter's lifespan.
Pressure-Driven Filtration (Squeeze Bottle or Pump)
Squeeze Bottle: Using a flexible, squeezable bottle lets students pressurize the filter for quicker water flow, useful for those on the go.
Small Hand Pump: Adding a mini pump, like those in camping filters, can increase the pressure and speed up the filtration process.
Gravity-Driven Drip System for Hydroponics
Automatic Drip Attachment: Add a drip nozzle after the filter to create a gravity-driven drip irrigation system. This allows for a slow, steady flow of filtered water into hydroponic systems or potted plants, keeping the soil or growing medium consistently moist.
Greywater Filtration for Gardens
Reusable Garden Watering System: Modify the filter to handle greywater (e.g., from washing dishes or hand washing) by filtering out soaps and oils. The filtered greywater can then be reused for garden irrigation, reducing waste and promoting water conservation.
Integrated Fertilizer Release for Hydroponics
Fertilizer Cartridge: Create a post-filter cartridge that slowly releases plant-safe nutrients or fertilizers into the water as itâ€™s dispensed, allowing for a steady nutrient supply in hydroponic setups. This could be a simple cartridge filled with slow-release fertilizer pellets or mineral stones.
Natural Water Source Filtration for Lakes/Rivers
Portable Cleanup Kit: Design the filter as part of a portable water cleanup kit for lake or river use. This could include a pre-filter net to capture larger debris, followed by the main filter to remove smaller contaminants before the water enters the ecosystem.
