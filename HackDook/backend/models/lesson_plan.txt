Lesson Background/Introduction: (Outline any basic background information needed to complete the lesson – what the trainers need to know to teach the material)


Human Taco training (Ice breaker activity) 
Learn about HCD and Durham-specific water issues
Pictures of the water model
Human-centered design (HCD) is a problem-solving approach that focuses on designing products, services, or systems with the needs, preferences, and experiences of people as the primary consideration. It emphasizes empathy and collaboration to create solutions that are functional, intuitive, and meaningful for users. In IGNITE, we scaffold the process for middle schoolers and break it down into Hear, Create, Deliver phases. We mostly give them the “hear phase” and have them do background research. In the water class, we focus on water problems, and this year will be trying to get them to engage with their family and community more about water problems that they might be experiencing. They will work on building filters and microscopes to filter contaminated water and/or be able to look at the different contaminants. 
See previous examples of filters and microscopes
Community and class norms
We will focus in the class a lot around community building and making sure the students feel comfortable enough to ask questions. Part of making sure that happens is making them think of you as a near-peer rather than a scary college student! The introductions should be fun, and you should try to show up with as much energy as possible. You will then work on setting classroom norms, which will be really important to classroom management throughout the program.

Ignite Week Two Lesson Plan

Lesson Abstract: 

Week:
Two
Design Stage:
Needs Assessment 
Abstract to Lesson Plan: (Max. 1 paragraph) 

This lesson will mainly focus on a silly introduction to the HCD/ engineering design process that students will engage in with their family/ someone who can sit at the computer with them. They will be working to save Jack (a gummy worm) from a capsized boat (a cup) by putting him in his life jacket (a gummy lifesaver) using only paper clips to manipulate the other materials. They will fill out a worksheet as they go. The hope is that this will engage the student’s family in the IGNITE process as well. 

We will also review HCD, and delve into what a needs assessment is. This will entail a lot of introduction around the water problems that exist in Durham and North Carolina broadly, and talking about water equity in Durham. We will then talk about what a needs statement is, and have students do some independent research and brainstorming on a needs statement related to water that incorporates anything they learned in their homework and during the lesson. 

They will then have the homework to interview their family/ community again with the knowledge they learned today in mind and refine their needs statement. The students will also update their posters.


Learning Objectives (L.O.): 
Introduce the engineering design process through a hands-on activity and increase family engagement with the program.
Understand what a needs assessment is.
Begin to understand the water problems in the Durham and NC community. 
Learn how to write a needs statement related to water problems in Durham.

Lesson Activity: 

Lesson Background/Introduction: (Outline any basic background information needed to complete the lesson – what the trainers need to know to teach the material)

Save Jack: See the description here (rebranded to “Saving Jack” like from titanic): Saving Sam (biologycorner.com) 

Durham Water problems: Plenty of links in the slides to learn about the issues. 
Boil Water Advisories: There have been instances where sections of Durham experienced low water pressure and outages due to operational issues. This led to boil water advisories being issued to prevent potential contamination.
Water Supply and Quality: Durham’s water supply comes from Lake Michie and Little River Reservoir. The city monitors water quality closely, and the 2021 Water Quality Report indicated that the water meets safety standards.
Drought and Water Levels: The city keeps track of lake levels and drought status to manage water resources effectively. Information on daily water demand, supply levels, and precipitation is regularly updated.

North Carolina water problems: Plenty of links in the slides to learn about the issues. 
PFAS Contamination: Over 300 water systems in North Carolina, including mobile home parks and daycare centers, exceed the EPA’s new drinking water standards for PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances). This issue is particularly severe along the Cape Fear River due to pollution from the Chemours plant in Fayetteville.
Water Shortages: Rapid population growth, drought, and aquifer degradation have led to water shortages in various parts of the state. If current trends continue, meeting water needs will become increasingly difficult.
Storm Impact: Severe weather events, such as hurricanes, can disrupt water supply and quality. For example, after Hurricane Helene, many residents were left without reliable access to drinking water.
Aging Infrastructure: Many water systems in North Carolina are aging and require significant upgrades to ensure safe and reliable water delivery.


Needs statement writing: 

Describe the Problem: Clearly define the issue or gap that needs to be addressed. Be specific.
Example: "Many residents in rural areas lack access to clean drinking water due to outdated infrastructure."
Identify the Target Audience or Stakeholders: Who is affected by the problem?
Example: "This issue affects over 3,000 households in rural North Carolina."
Highlight Importance: Explain why solving this problem is critical.
Example: "Without clean water access, these households are at risk of waterborne diseases and dehydration."
Define Constraints and Criteria: What are the limits (budget, materials, time) and the expectations for success?
Example: "The solution must be cost-effective, require minimal maintenance, and be easy to implement in a rural setting."
For the students to select/ fill in which they are most interested in: My community needs a way to conserve/ monitor/ filter our storm water/streams/ lakes water.

Ignite Week Three Lesson Plan

Lesson Abstract: 

Week: 
Three


Design Stage:
Skill-building 
Abstract to Lesson Plan: (Max. 1 paragraph) 
Summary description of the main activity(ies) of your lesson plan and the main learning goal for each activity. Include aspects of the lesson that are unique and innovative. Think about what you would tell the parents about.

In week three, the main focus will be on building skills for the students to be able to prototype in subsequent weeks. This lesson plan focuses on engaging students in hands-on exploration of key environmental indicators related to water quality and watershed health. The session begins with a collaborative shareback, where students reflect on insights from their homework. Following this, students rotate through four stations, each designed to deepen their understanding of water quality analysis and environmental challenges. The stations include: measuring water quality indicators such as pH, turbidity, and dissolved oxygen using a YSI device; analyzing biological indicators with HCD microscopes and foldscopes; testing various water filtration methods; and examining local water issues in Durham through a watershed model and peer review. The session concludes with a debrief, allowing students to consolidate their learning and prepare for future assignments.


Learning Objectives (L.O.): 

Reflect and articulate key takeaways from the assigned homework, fostering collaborative learning through group discussion.
Microscopes and foldscopes: Identify and analyze water quality indicators in samples using microscopes and foldscopes to assess water quality.
Filter design: Evaluate the effectiveness of various filters and casings in removing contaminants from water, enhancing understanding of filtration systems.

Lesson Activity: 

Lesson Background/Introduction: (Outline any basic background information needed to complete the lesson – what the trainers need to know to teach the material)

Debrief: look over previous assigned homeworks if submitted to the GClassroom to be able to discuss and review with students 
Stations: 
Station 1: Water indicators
pH scale: measures how acidic or basic (alkaline) a substance is from 0-14
pH = 7: neutral (water); pH < 7: acidic (e.g. lemon juice - 2); pH > 7: (e.g. soap - 10, bleach - 12)
Extreme pH levels can harm aquatic life, healthy pH levels are typically between 6.5-8.5
Turbidity: measure of how clear or cloudy the water is
The higher the turbidity, the cloudier the water is
turbidity below 5 NTU (measurement for the turbidity) appears clear, a reading of 55 NTU starts to look cloudy
turbidity of drinking water should never exceed 1.0 NTU
Dissolved Oxygen: amount of oxygen dissolved in water
oxygen that is absorbed from the air and can be used by aquatic organisms living in it
crucial for survival of fish and other aquatic life
measured in milligrams per liter (mg/L), healthy water considered to have levels between 6.5-8 mg/L
YSI
device that measures water parameters - dissolved oxygen, total algae, turbidity, pH, conductivity, salinity, and others
Secchi disk
measures water transparency or turbidity in bodies of water. 
The disc is mounted on a pole or line and lowered slowly down in the water, and the depth at which the disk is no longer visible is taken as a measure of the transparency of the water.
Station 2: Microscopes and foldscopes 
The USAF 1951 (United States Air Force) resolution target is a standardized test pattern widely used to evaluate the resolving power of optical instruments like microscopes, cameras, and imaging systems. Originally developed for the military, it features a set of grouped line patterns of varying sizes, allowing users to measure the smallest resolvable detail an optical system can distinguish. Each group consists of three horizontal and three vertical line pairs, and as the pattern progresses, the line widths become narrower.
How it works:The smallest resolvable line pair on the target (the point where lines can still be distinguished from each other) corresponds to the resolving power of the optical system. This resolution is expressed in terms of line pairs per millimeter (lp/mm). The higher the resolving power, the finer the detail the system can visualize.
A Foldscope is a low-cost, portable, paper-based microscope designed to make microscopy accessible to everyone, especially in resource-limited settings. It was invented by Dr. Manu Prakash and his team at Stanford University as a tool for educational purposes, field research, and global health initiatives.
Station 3: Testing filters 
To create a simple water filter that middle schoolers can use, a few easily accessible materials can be layered to demonstrate basic filtration principles. The main materials include sand and gravel, which mimic natural filtration by trapping large and small particles. Activated charcoal is key for absorbing chemicals and impurities, making it a useful component for purifying water. Coffee filters, cotton balls, or fabric can be used as pre-filters or final layers to catch fine debris and sediment.
A plastic bottle serves as the structure for the filter, with its bottom cut off to allow for layering. Small pebbles or aquarium gravel help create gaps for water to flow, while fine mesh or cheesecloth can be placed at the bottom to prevent materials from falling out. These simple materials are effective for demonstrating how water filtration works, though the filtered water would need additional treatment, like boiling or chemical disinfection, to be safe for drinking
Station 4: Watershed model
Watershed: area of land where all the water that falls as rain drains into a common water body, such as river, lake, or ocean, 
transports water and nutrients across the landscape, but they can also carry pollutants
How water pollution spreads:
Runoff: Rain and snowmelt carry pollutants from land into waterways, such as rivers, streams, and bays. These pollutants come from many sources, including motor oil, pesticides, and fertilizers.
Groundwater: Rainfall can seep through soil and pick up pollutants from buried waste or other sources, and then contaminate groundwater (could reach drinking water systems)
Other sources: oil spills, carbon pollution, marine debris
Durham public schools
founded in 1992
57 public schools in the system
Jordan Lake: currently not a water source for Durham (is for other counties BUT will begin to be a source in a few years)
A reservoir - large natural or artificial lake used as a source of water supply

Agenda for the day: (Step by step description of activity including breakdown of time)

Overview:
Debrief the homework and give feedback in pairs on each other's needs statements, introduce the stations and divide into groups. 20min
Stations (4x): 17 min each (3 min transition between each station)
Primary indicators of water: Exploring pH, Turbidity, and DO with YSI 
HCD Microscopes and foldscopes 
Testing different filters
Watershed model, some more about water problems in Durham, and finalize facts and needs statements/ go over with trainers. 
Debrief and homework 20 min 

Detailed Agenda: 
11:00 - 11:20: Debrief homework that was completed (needs statement refinement and interviews). Have students share with each other in partners, then share with the class. (20 min) 
11:00 - 11:05: waiting for students to come in and have them pull out materials and notes from interviews
11:05 - 11:13: have students share with each other who they interviewed, what they learned, and how they refined their needs statements based on what they learned. Provide feedback to each other. 
11:13 - 11:16: have a few students share back to the class about what they talked about. 
11:16 - 11:20: Introduce the stations and break the class into four groups to rotate through the stations.  
11:20 - 12:40: Stations (20 min each, 5 min of explanation, then 13 min to complete activities, 2 min to reset the station): 
Water Indicators (2 trainers) 
Introduction to Water Quality and Indicators (5 min):
Briefly explain why monitoring pH, turbidity, and DO is essential for understanding water quality and ecosystem health using the slides
Give handouts about them and have students fill out worksheets
Hands-On Demonstration and Exploration (13 min):
Start with a trainer-led demonstration on using each tool: the pH test strip, YSI device, and Secchi disk.
Show the expected results for tap water as a baseline to help students understand how the devices work.
Have students try the different testing methods on the various waters, record in worksheets and notebooks what they see
Microscopes and foldscopes (1 trainer), for each of the microscopes (foldscope, glasses, handheld digital microscopes, and Compound microscope, have students rotate through and record their determined resolution on the worksheet):
Place the USAF Target on the Stage: Secure the target on the microscope stage and ensure it's properly aligned for observation.
Adjust the Magnification: Begin by using the microscope's lowest magnification to observe the largest line patterns. Gradually increase the magnification to resolve finer details.
Find the Resolution Limit: Starting with the largest line pair, focus on the lines, and determine the point at which the individual lines within the smallest group are no longer distinguishable. The smallest discernible line pairs represent the resolution limit.
Compare Horizontal and Vertical Lines: Microscopes should ideally resolve horizontal and vertical lines equally well. If there’s a difference, it might indicate an issue with alignment or aberrations in the optical system.
Calculate Resolution: Once you’ve identified the smallest resolved group and element on the target, use the provided chart on the worksheet to convert this into a resolution value (μm).
Repeat the process for each microscope
Testing filters (2 trainers): 
Have students describe filters that they made and write the materials and order that they used them in after demonstrating a couple of different prototypes.Instructions:
First Layer (bottom, near bottle opening): Place a coffee filter or a piece of clean cloth at the bottom inside the bottle opening. This keeps the filtering materials from falling through.
Second Layer (Charcoal): Crush charcoal into small pieces (but not powder). Place about 2-3 inches of this layer over the coffee filter. Charcoal helps absorb impurities.
Third Layer (Fine Sand): Add 2-3 inches of fine sand on top of the charcoal layer. Sand helps filter out small particles.
Fourth Layer (Coarse Sand): Add a layer of coarse sand, also about 2-3 inches, on top of the fine sand.
Fifth Layer (Gravel or Small Pebbles): Finally, place 1-2 inches of gravel or small pebbles on top. This layer filters out larger particles and prevents the sand from getting disturbed when you pour water.
Students will measure the effectiveness of their prototype using the Secchi disk. Pour dirty water slowly over the top of the bottle into another bottle or tray. You will add the collected water to a graduated cylinder until the disk is no longer visible to the naked eye. The resulting reading is the Secchi depth or transparency of the water.How much water does it take until you cannot see the disk at the bottom? Look straight through the top and record either mL of water of cm from the table.
Watershed model (1 trainer): 
Introduction to Watersheds (2 min)
Teach students about watersheds, different landmarks, different water sources
Have students fill out worksheet during the station
Exploring the Watershed Model (5 min)
Hands-On Interaction: Let students interact with the watershed model to see how water flows through different parts of a watershed
Ask students to identify how water carries pollutants to different parts of the watershed
Types of Pollutants (6 min): Introduce common pollutants found in Durham’s water sources, like:
Nutrients (from fertilizers and agricultural runoff),
Sediments (from construction and erosion),
Chemicals (from urban runoff, including oil, metals, and household waste),
Pathogens (from waste or sewage leaks)
Locating Sites for Testing and Product Development (5 min)
Choosing a Test Site: Have students brainstorm potential testing sites within Durham where they might want to measure water quality. Encourage them to think about sites affected by different types of pollution.
Application to Product Development: Connect the idea of testing sites to the need for their product (like a water filter or pollution indicator), explaining that scientists choose locations based on the types of contaminants they want to address.
Interactive tutorials (if time allows)
Links shown on slides - iPads provided
12:40 - 1:00: Assign homework for poster completion
12:40 - 12:44: Have students spend 4 min talking in their station groups about what the most interesting/ surprising thing they learned today was. Ask them to think about any questions they have going into the brainstorming week. 
12:44 - 12:53: Have a few students from each group shareback what their groups talked about and ask any questions they might have about what they learned today. Have students raise hands for which prototype they will be building. 
12:53 - 1:00: Walk through the google classroom to show students how to update their poster sections for the needs statement and the background information.

Four
Design Stage:
Brainstorming
Abstract to Lesson Plan: (Max. 1 paragraph) 
Summary description of the main activity(ies) of your lesson plan and the main learning goal for each activity. Include aspects of the lesson that are unique and innovative. Think about what you would tell the parents about.

In week four, the primary objective is to equip students with the necessary knowledge for them to begin prototyping their final project through brainstorming and sketching. The lesson plan centers on facilitating hands-on exploration of design principles through the creation of water filters. After the class begins, trainers will present examples of water filter materials and their specific contributions to the design, emphasizing the pros and cons of various approaches. Students will then engage in individual brainstorming about how they want to make their water filters. They will sketch prototypes and outline construction steps for the upcoming lab session. The core of the lesson includes small group discussions, where students receive feedback on their posters and designs from peers and trainers. The session concludes with a summary of group discussions, and students will be assigned homework to finalize their sketches and incorporate feedback into their posters. 



Learning Objectives (L.O.): 
Identify Key Design Components: Students will be able to explain the purpose and functionality of various materials in water filter designs, understanding the strengths and limitations of each component.
Develop and Justify a Prototype Concept: Students will select appropriate materials and sketch a preliminary design for their water filters.
Engage in Constructive Peer Feedback: Students will present their designs to small groups, actively participate in feedback sessions, and refine their prototypes based on peer and trainer input, improving their designs with new insights.

Commonly used in labs to create a protective, flexible seal over parts.
Balloon
When stretched, a balloon can act as a thin membrane or lens that can magnify small objects when properly positioned
Can be adjusted for different levels of magnification based on tension and thickness.
pH Strip
pH strips can be used to test the microscope environment for specific scientific experiments, especially if samples involve testing chemical reactions or environmental factors.
Plexiglass
Provides a clear, sturdy surface for mounting specimens and lenses
Often used as a stage platform, allowing light to pass through the specimen for enhanced visibility and magnification.
Knex
Interlocking pieces can be used to construct the frame or body of the microscope
Offers flexibility to adjust height and angles of different parts, such as the stage or lens holder.
Carriage Bolt
Used as a stable, adjustable focusing mechanism; by rotating the bolt, the lens or stage height can be finely tuned to achieve the best possible focus on a specimen.
Filters (build examples) 
Sand, Gravel, and Mulch
Coarse Gravel: Serves as a primary filter to catch large particles like leaves or twigs.
Fine Gravel: Helps trap smaller particles that make it past the coarse gravel.
Sand: Acts as the second filter layer, trapping finer dirt and impurities.
These materials mimic natural water filtration processes, as layers of sand and gravel are often used in real-life water filtration systems.
Activated Charcoal
Activated Charcoal (Carbon): This material is highly porous and adsorbs impurities, odors, and chemicals from the water. It’s an essential component for removing organic compounds and chlorine.
Activated charcoal is used in many commercial water filters because it can effectively purify water by binding harmful contaminants to its surface.
Coffee Filters or Cotton Fabric
Coffee Filters: These can serve as a final filtering layer to catch any fine particles that remain in the water after passing through other materials.
Cotton Fabric or Gauze: Another option for filtering out smaller particles. It can be placed at the very top or bottom of the filter layers.
These materials work as simple pre-filters to remove large sediment or to provide extra filtration at the end.
Small Pebbles or Aquarium Rocks
Aquarium Gravel or Small Pebbles: These are easily accessible and can be used as an alternative to natural gravel. They help in creating gaps for water to flow while filtering out debris.
Cotton Balls
Cotton Balls: These are used as a soft layer that can catch smaller particles that pass through the sand and gravel. Cotton balls are also great for absorbing some impurities.
Cotton acts as a physical barrier and can help clean water from larger sediments.
Cheesecloth
Cheesecloth: Similar to a coffee filter, it can be placed between layers of filtering materials or at the very top to catch fine debris before water flows through the entire filter.
Examples are given in the slides of different types of water filters, both from previous students and from other sources to give students ideas about what ways to use the materials. 
Brainstorming 
Based on everything they have heard up to this point, each student will think on their own about if they want to continue with their project (filter vs. microscope) and finalize one in this stage. The trainers must stress about choosing one of these, as this is the last chance which they can change.
After spending a couple minutes finalizing which project to complete, the trainers should tell each student to think about which materials they want to use and how their design will be implemented.
Have them write justification for each material to their posters, sketch a prototype of their design, and write down steps of how they will complete their posters.
Read through posters and give feedback 
We will be breaking into small groups to look over what students submitted for homework (completed hear phase of the poster) and what they have added during the session (plan for how they will build the prototype, what materials they will use, a sketch of their prototype, and the design criteria for their prototype). 
Trainers should divide up student submissions to review them in advance and write down any comments or feedback you have on the Hear phase section, and have the folder with the posters ready to be pulled up during small group brainstorming and feedback sections. Trainers should follow up and look at their assigned students’ posters after week 4 to ensure they are complete. If not, reach out to each student to complete before week 5. 


Agenda for the day: (Step by step description of activity including breakdown of time)

One trainer per breakout room should open each student’s posters and be ready to screen share. 

11:00 - 11:05: Have resources up for students to scan as they come into zoom room
11:05 - 11:13: Go through examples of water filters and what each material contributes to the design (5 min)
Walk through what each material does and examples of previous designs, think about pros and cons of the different examples. 
11:13 - 11:15: Present examples of microscopes. If students finish their water filters early, they could build microscopes and test their water filters.
Ask what they remember about microscopes, and if time permits, ask what they like about the examples of the microscopes.
11:15 - 11:19: What is a design requirement?
Examples. 
11:19 - 11:29: Individual brainstorming about the design of their water filter
What does your water filter need to be able to do? 
Think about what materials they want to use and justify why

Write down steps for how to build this next week in lab 
11:29 - 11:54: Small group feedback and brainstorming (25 min)
2 trainers per group, 2 break out rooms, one group stay in the main room
Have students pick one person to share back what the group talked about before leaving the breakout room.  
One trainer will pull up each student's poster. Students will read out their background, needs statement, and what materials they will use. Other students can give feedback on these. They will also hold up and explain the sketch they drew of their prototype (2-2.5 min of students presenting, 2 min of feedback from other students). 
Examples of design requirements: 
Removes Dirt and Sand: The filter should be able to make cloudy, dirty water look clear by removing dirt, sand, and other small particles.
Portable and Lightweight: The filter should be easy to carry and light enough to hold.
Easy to Build: The device should be easy to make using simple, safe materials
Durable for Multiple Uses: The filter device should be able to be used at least 10 times without breaking or needing new materials.
Guiding questions: 
Why did you choose the materials that you chose? Do you feel ready to build this next week? 
How does the sketch you drew help meet the requirements you listed? 
11:54 - 12:00: Homework assignment and share out about what the group talked about
Share back student shares out what the group talked about (1 min or less per group) 
Assign homework to finalize sketches based on feedback and add to posters, answer any questions 


Homework Assignment for Next Week: (Google classroom assignment, at a minimum, poster section they should complete)

Update any components of your poster based on feedback you got in small groups, update your sketch if necessary and make sure to have a good plan. Upload pictures of sketches to posters or bring them to MLS so trainers can scan pictures of it for your posters.

Differentiation Strategies: 
(Are there ways to make the activity more or less challenging?)

If there are students that you suspect might need more support with these tasks, creating a digital whiteboard with some pre-filled in ideas that they can drag around might be helpful as a starting point. For students who might need help initiating ideas, send specific prompts or questions they can consider in each brainstorming session. You can also encourage students to use either their voices or the chat to respond in the group as some students may be more comfortable with one vs the other.

Building
Abstract to Lesson Plan: (Max. 1 paragraph) 
Summary description of the main activity(ies) of your lesson plan and the main learning goal for each activity. Include aspects of the lesson that are unique and innovative. Think about what you would tell the parents about.
In this lesson, students will build and test water filter prototypes, learning about filtration principles and applying problem-solving skills. After a brief introduction to review materials, students will construct filters while small groups collect water samples from a nearby creek. Those who finish early can build a microscope for further exploration. Once completed, students test their filters with the creek water, record observations, and note results on worksheets. The session ends with a clean-up and a discussion, where students reflect on what worked and didn’t, reinforcing their learning through shared insights. The objectives are to develop an understanding of water filtration, practice hands-on problem-solving, and reflect collaboratively on the design process.

Learning Objectives (L.O.): 
Understand the principles of water filtration by building a functional water filter prototype and testing it with collected water samples.
Gain practical experience in environmental testing by using natural creek water samples to assess the effectiveness of their water filter prototypes.
Reflect on design effectiveness by analyzing the success and challenges of their prototypes, recording observations, and sharing insights with peers.

Lesson Activity: 

Lesson Background/Introduction: (Outline any basic background information needed to complete the lesson – what the trainers need to know to teach the material)

See weeks 3 and 4 for background information. If students want to make their designs better/ include other components after the initial filter they can try things like: 
Storage and Dispensing Mechanism
Attached Clean Water Reservoir: Add a small container or bottle that collects and stores the filtered water, allowing for easy dispensing when needed.
Spout or Tap: Install a simple tap or spout at the bottom of the reservoir to make it easy to pour without spilling.
UV Light Sterilization
UV Pen or Small UV Light: Placing a small UV sterilizer after filtration helps kill remaining bacteria and viruses, especially useful for biological safety. A portable UV pen could be placed in the reservoir to add a final purification step.
Post-Filtration Mineralization
Mineral Stones: Adding minerals like calcite or quartz after the main filter can help balance the pH and add a subtle mineral taste to the water, making it healthier and more enjoyable to drink.
Recyclable or Replaceable Filter Cartridges
Modular Filter Compartments: Design replaceable filter cartridges or layers that can be swapped out, making maintenance easier and increasing the filter's lifespan.
Pressure-Driven Filtration (Squeeze Bottle or Pump)
Squeeze Bottle: Using a flexible, squeezable bottle lets students pressurize the filter for quicker water flow, useful for those on the go.
Small Hand Pump: Adding a mini pump, like those in camping filters, can increase the pressure and speed up the filtration process.
Gravity-Driven Drip System for Hydroponics
Automatic Drip Attachment: Add a drip nozzle after the filter to create a gravity-driven drip irrigation system. This allows for a slow, steady flow of filtered water into hydroponic systems or potted plants, keeping the soil or growing medium consistently moist.
Greywater Filtration for Gardens
Reusable Garden Watering System: Modify the filter to handle greywater (e.g., from washing dishes or hand washing) by filtering out soaps and oils. The filtered greywater can then be reused for garden irrigation, reducing waste and promoting water conservation.
Integrated Fertilizer Release for Hydroponics
Fertilizer Cartridge: Create a post-filter cartridge that slowly releases plant-safe nutrients or fertilizers into the water as it’s dispensed, allowing for a steady nutrient supply in hydroponic setups. This could be a simple cartridge filled with slow-release fertilizer pellets or mineral stones.
Natural Water Source Filtration for Lakes/Rivers
Portable Cleanup Kit: Design the filter as part of a portable water cleanup kit for lake or river use. This could include a pre-filter net to capture larger debris, followed by the main filter to remove smaller contaminants before the water enters the ecosystem.


Agenda for the day: (Step by step description of activity including breakdown of time)

11:00 - 11:10 am. 10 min with QR codes and microscope instructions up as they come in to review, get settled and look at them. 
Trainers hand out the poster print outs as they come in as well
11:10 - 12:20 pm. Everyone will be working on building water filter prototypes. 
While students are building, 2 trainers will bring groups of 4-5 students down to the creek to collect water samples to use for testing prototypes (about 10-15 min per group) 
If students finish building water filters, they can individually or team up to build a microscope using the instructions provided. They can test with the microscopes this week or on week 7. 
12:20-12:40 pm. Test your prototype with the water collected, record data and write down on worksheets (YSI- pH, DO%, temp, turbidity; Secchi disk- distance in cm until you can’t see the disk; microscope- observations of any particulate when looking at the water).
Trainers take pictures of prototypes and of the worksheets.
12:40-12:50 pm. Clean up all materials. Share with someone about your prototype while you work on cleaning up! 
12:50- 1:00 pm. Share back to the class about what worked and what didn’t today. 




Homework Assignment for Next Week: (Google classroom assignment, at a minimum, poster section they should complete)

Upload a picture of your first prototype and testing results to your posters! Update the materials that you actually used to build with and the steps you took to build. Also write down some of the things you liked about the design (pros) and the things you might want to change when finalizing it in the last week (deltas). Put any initial testing results on the poster as well. 



Assessment of Activity: (What will trainers need to have accomplished by the end of the day?)

Have each student complete their initial prototype and test it using water they collected from the creek. Trainers should take pictures of prototypes and the worksheets so they can upload them to posters.

**In between sessions, trainers should each take on 7 students’ posters to check, email them if they are not updated before the next session. They will be sharing the posters for feedback in the next session.**

Iteration
Abstract to Lesson Plan: (Max. 1 paragraph) 
Summary description of the main activity(ies) of your lesson plan and the main learning goal for each activity. Include aspects of the lesson that are unique and innovative. Think about what you would tell the parents about.

In this session, students are diving into improving their prototypes by brainstorming together and giving each other feedback. The class kicks off with some quick time for everyone to add updates to their posters, then splits into three groups (two breakout rooms and a main room). Trainers start things off by going over a few common issues people run into with prototypes, and the groups brainstorm solutions, listing out the pros and cons. After that, each student gets a chance to present their prototype progress, get feedback, and brainstorm ways to make it even better. They’re encouraged to think about any materials they could bring from home to enhance their designs. If they finish early, they can keep working on their posters or watch a short video that ties into the project. The session wraps up with everyone gathering back in the main room, and students are assigned homework to finalize their posters with their plans for the final build. To keep things fun, students earn a piece of candy in an upcoming session for each piece of helpful feedback they give to others this week!


Learning Objectives (L.O.): 
Develop collaborative brainstorming skills: Students will learn to give constructive feedback and collaborate with peers to improve each other's prototypes, fostering teamwork and creative problem-solving.
Enhance prototype iteration: Students will apply critical thinking to identify areas for improvement in their prototypes, evaluate potential solutions, and refine their designs based on peer feedback.
Plan and communicate design ideas: Students will organize their design ideas visually on posters, effectively communicate their progress, and outline materials they can bring from home to enhance their final build.

Strengths and Improvements:
Look for stability (can it stand up by itself so you only use one hand to pour water instead of another one to hold up the filter), functionality, ease of use, self-surviving, layered materials, and separated sections
Through listing these out, trainers can guide students to think about various solutions that could help, and encourage them to think about what could help:
Materials
Structure
Features
Guiding Questions
If students are struggling or not motivated to speak, trainers can ask them these questions to help guide the students
“What purpose does this part of the prototype serve?”
“What would make this feature even stronger or easier to use?”
“How could you change this part to improve stability or functionality?”
“What materials could enhance this part of the prototype?”
“What did you observe during testing that could be improved?”
“What differences do you see in this prototype compared to others?”
“What materials can be substituted or added in to strengthen the prototype?”
Reflection prompts for growth
“What feedback did you find most helpful, and why?”
“How will you prioritize your changes based on the feedback?”
“What materials will you use for each change?”

Homework Assignment for Next Week: (Google classroom assignment, at a minimum, poster section they should complete)

If students have not fully completed their posters (according to poster progress sheet: Poster Progress), instruct them to finish by their posters Monday, the 17th. Trainers should then review posters on Monday afternoon and email any students who have not yet finished. Posters will need to be sent for printing on Wednesday, the 19th, so trainers will be in charge of updating any last minute details after Tuesday evening. 

Have the students also practice what they want to talk about during Duke Day. Frame it to students as an elevator pitch- think about talking for about 5 minutes on why you made your filter the way you did, what problem it can solve, and the testing results. 



Assessment of Activity: (What will trainers need to have accomplished by the end of the day?)


Posters should be complete or near complete by the end of the period, and each student should have a final design in a bin with their name on it at the end of the day.

When students transition to testing, one of these trainers will be in charge of YSI devices, one in charge of Secchi disks, and one will remain with students building to help finalize designs. 

Another trainer will be in charge of the hand drills and can drill a hole if a student needs it.

Another trainer will be in charge of monitoring students to see if they finish early and helping direct them to the options listed above in differentiation and helping to build the microscopes.

Remaining trainers will be in charge of monitoring materials and keeping them organized during building and testing.
