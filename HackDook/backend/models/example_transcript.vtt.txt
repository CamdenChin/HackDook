00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.760
Ms. Rivera: Welcome everyone to today's Ignite session! We're going to kick off our Water curriculum.

2
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.212
Ms. Rivera: Remember, Ignite is all about engineering and solving problems that matter to our community.

3
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.289
Alex Turner: Hi Ms. Rivera! I’m excited to learn how to design a water filter to help reduce pollution.

4
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.420
Jordan Lee: Good morning! I brought some sand and gravel from home to use in our model.

5
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:24.360
Ms. Rivera: That’s fantastic, Jordan. Let’s use these materials and remember to think about how our design will benefit our local community.

6
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.490
Taylor Kim: I wonder if adding a coffee filter as a first layer would help trap impurities?

7
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.690
Chris Davis: Great idea, Taylor! It might just work like a mini prototype.

8
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.670
Morgan Patel: And what about testing for algae? I read that algae blooms can affect water quality.

9
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.230
Alex Turner: True, Morgan. Our design could also include steps to handle water pollution.

10
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.610
Ms. Rivera: Excellent questions, everyone. Let’s break into groups and start prototyping our water filtration systems.

11
00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.770
Jordan Lee: I love how this project combines science, engineering, and community care. It really feels like what Ignite is all about.

12
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:58.440
Taylor Kim: Plus, thinking about how our work can help improve water quality makes me want to be an engineer even more!

13
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.529
Chris Davis: Agreed! I can already see how the human-centered design process is making a real-world impact.

14
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.710
Morgan Patel: Let’s start building our model now and then share our ideas with the class.

15
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.150
Ms. Rivera: Great work, everyone. Keep focusing on innovation and community—Ignite is just getting started!
